Bugs to fix:
- Boundaries dont scare properly
- Performance issues on lower-end devices
- More clarity when taking/dealing damage
- Game looks *too* basic (some more colors/anims would be nice)
- Lack of a proper tutorial (no explanation on what the pickups do)

New Features:
- Proper levels (not just arenas)
  - Have some form of exploration or platforming (like RnC3)
